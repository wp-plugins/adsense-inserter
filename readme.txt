An easy way to insert Adsense ads into your Wordpress site.

== Description ==

A truly lightweight plugin for adding Adsense ads to any of your post or pages; including your homepage.

Many plugins for adding Adsense ads to your site are riddled with complex features and code.  This may be good for some site owners, but many just want to place ads on their sites without the code being skewed by wpautop or other functions.

Adsense Inserter allows you to easily place your Adsense ads on your pages and post without adding a bunch of code and processing time to your site.

The extremely lightweight code lets you create as a many ads as you want.  Then simply place the ads where ever you like on your site using the shortcode [adsense_inserter id="%postId%"].

You can place the Adsense Inserter shortcodes in the visual editor or in the code editor.  You can wrap them in div tags and control their placement on your site.

I create the Adsense Inserter because nothing else out there was lightweight enough for placing Adsense ads on my pages.  I tried pasting the Adsense ads directly into my code, but always end up with broken code because of wpautop.  I am now using Adsense Inserter on my Adsense sites.

You can use the Adsense Inserter plugin to place Adsense display ads and Adsense link units.

###What you get when you use the Adsense Inserter plugin

*  Place an Adsense ad with a simple shortcode [adsense_inserter id="%postId%"]
*  Put Adsense ads on any post or page.

Things to consider when using Adsense Inserter for your adsense ads

Be sure to follow Google's policy rules for adsense.
